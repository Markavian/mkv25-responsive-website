	<description><![CDATA[This logo is an example of my abilities with Paint Shop Pro. Wait.. I got a feeling I already said that some where else before... its like time.. repeating its self... ::shudder::. No, probably all in the mind.

This logo was created by layering the same piece of text several times, and then applying different effects to each layer. By altering the transparency of each layer, the crispness of the overall image could be set.

I seem to have blurred then moasaic\'ed one of the layers to give that crystal halo around the text. I felt this one was better suited on a whitebackground because of the faintness of the text. I probably worked in green then inverted the colours.]]></description>
