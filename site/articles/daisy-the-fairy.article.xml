	<description><![CDATA[I got a pressure sensitive graphics tablet for xmas, but I wasn\'t very impressed with it, it had two major glitches which rendered large portions of the tablet unusable.

The best drawing I did, was Daisy, the Fairy... half copied off a christmas card. 

Its okay, its kinda fun drawing using a tablet, but I couldn\'t reproduce the fine curves that you can get by using a pencil (infact, it wasn\'t even close).

I\'ll just stick to paper for the moment! Daisy will be my reminder.]]></description>
