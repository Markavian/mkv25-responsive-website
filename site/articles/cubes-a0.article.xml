	<description><![CDATA[This was an idea I had, but never quite saw through. Basically, I separately rendered 8 boxes in 3D Studio Max at different positions in a matrix using a fixed camera. I then imported these into Flash, and traced around them. I then made them into symbols, and gave them different colours.

After all that effort, the idea was to have them fade in from side to side, I wanted to do a 3x3x3 grid, but that would have taken ages. I was then thinking about 3 sets of opposite poles, kinda lovehate, peacewar, or something... and have the colours change between them, and to either side, and have a related bit of information to each of the 27 blocks.

Still alot of thinking to do on this one.]]></description>
