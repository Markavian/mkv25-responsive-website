Anyhow, \'Mendomic\' bevels. Funny shapes bevelled up to give them a it more depth, even realism.

(Note: creating things that look \'real\', or could be \'real\' is a hot area of digital design)

Anyhow, these objects are the result of a bevelled effect applied to shapes created using my Flash mendomic shape creator.

The origins of that project were a direct copy of work by Jared Tarbel, from his excellent site http://www.levitated.net .]]></description>
