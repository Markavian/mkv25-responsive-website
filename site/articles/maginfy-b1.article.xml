	<description><![CDATA[Roll your mouse over the triangles, see how they move!


This is an advancement from Magnify (a0). 
The main difference is the maths processing, and the added interaction/tweening implemented when you click on the movie.

As you roll over each point, it interacts individually, but as a whole they reveal and underlying application, a magnified spherical shape.

The whole idea for the project is a direct copy of the work done by Jared Tarbel. I can\'t credit this guy enough, hes really inspired me to do the stuff I do with Flash.
