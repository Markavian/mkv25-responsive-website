	<description><![CDATA[I made this one very late night, it came together wondefully. I sat, and I stared, and I stared... and the colours just reached out to me, facinating.

This animation is very user interactive. Stick with it for a while.
- The X axis, left - right controls the speed and direction of the movement.
- The Y axis, up - down controls the density of the new layers.
- Clicking subtly changes the colour.

- Ocassionally the colour will change on its own.

Control the colourful waves, mix diffent speeds and densities, wave the direction around. The interaction of the new layer, a sort of drawing tool, creates amazing combinations.

The best palettes emerge just as the colour switches, and the new colour layers itself ontop of the previous one.
