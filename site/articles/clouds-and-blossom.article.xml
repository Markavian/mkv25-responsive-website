	<description><![CDATA[Bored at work, one day, I drew this picture of Blossom in Macromedia Fireworks. This was before I found out how good Macromedia Flash was.

This was also my first attempt at drawinga background. I based it on the backdrop of my desktop, it came out well.. but blossom looks a little off... Fireworks rounds the lines off too much, I couldn\'t find out a way to have sharp corners easily, and the lines around the eyes are too thin.

Practice makes perfect tho!
This is in the abandoned section because I don\'t really like it, I don\'t think I\'ll ever use Firworks for this sort of drawing again. All the outlines are just wrong!]]></description>
