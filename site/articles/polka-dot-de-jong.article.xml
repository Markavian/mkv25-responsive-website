	<description><![CDATA[A colourful, small bit of artwork, created from screens of Jared Tarbel\'s \"Peter De Jong\" particle attractor script, which in turn was based off code from other sources (namely Paul Bourke). Using source graphics produced by Jared\'s applets I merged different timed images together and played around with effects until I was bored.

Amazing what you can do with lots of layers and a few blurry effects.]]></description>
