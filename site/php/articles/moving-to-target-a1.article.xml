	<description>Based on the method drawPointsToTarget() this builds upon fuctions already derived to simulate the movement of a ship through space. The ship has a minimum turning angle and will animate between its current position and the target position signified by clicking the mouse.

So basically, click on the screen and the space ship (the red thing) will follow the path until it reaches the target or runs out of movement for that click.

This applet also draws on the initial work from \'Space Battle a1\' where I tested that it was possible to rotate loaded graphics on the screen.</description>
