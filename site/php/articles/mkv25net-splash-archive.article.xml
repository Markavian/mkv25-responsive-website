	<description><![CDATA[When I gave my website a recolouring from its previous light flimsy grey... I pushed on with a crayola coloured blue, which adorned everything.

I left it there along with the archive.

mkv25.net archive was my second major attempt at a full Content Management System (CMS). All the original files and articles are left there for people to view, and should come up on google searches next month.

Thanks to all who submitted articles! They helped the site a great deal, even though things never really took off. It was a fun thing to create, the CMS is still in full operation too...]]></description>
