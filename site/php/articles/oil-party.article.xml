	<description>A tea party scene, with a difference... backed by an oil storage unit. Or something.

This 3D render is the acomplishment of an idea I\'ve had for a while now. I spent ages on the lighting, creating a bright scene, with vague shadows. I wanted soft, blurry shadows, but couldn\'t find the right options.

I went with 5 scene lights, 3 providing all round illumination, 1 vertical spot light facing straight down, and a 5th offset shadow up top right from the camera.

The result is a semi-realistic scene, that looks more detailed and alive then a basic render. Adding detail to the scene created extra depth to the objects, providing minor shading to the different elements.

I especially like the designer chairs around the table; so simple to put together, and so appealing... I want one for my room! Maybe in blue tho, not white.</description>
