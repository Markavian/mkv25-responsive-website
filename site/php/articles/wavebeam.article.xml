	<description>Finally, something fun! A game that\'ve been putting together since Thursday night. Spent well over a full day on it today, and I\'m so very pleased with the results. I get to shoot stuff, and stuff explodes.

Story line in development, got some friends helping me on that, and I\'ve put some <a href=\"showcase/storyboards.png\" target=\"_blank\">storyboards doodled</a> out to help me think.

Movement:
 UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT for movement.
Weapons:
 a - Evil Red Laser
 s - Torpedo / Bullets
 z - Plasma Charge
 x - Wave Beam

Weapons are likely to change, I just smacked on four hardpoints so I could try out a variety of weapons. Have fun.

Update: v3 has a key mapping system that saves between goes (using SharedObject), and a planned feature for ship rotation...
