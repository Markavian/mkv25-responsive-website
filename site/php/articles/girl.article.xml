	<description><![CDATA[This girl character was drawn as part of an idea I had to do with Animal Crossing (if you\'ve ever heard of that game).

She has been put together using different objects for most of her main features, so that they can be changed stylisticly (hair and eye colour) and also be given the ability for simple animation. 

Click a few times... you\'ll sorta get the idea. Very early development?]]></description>
