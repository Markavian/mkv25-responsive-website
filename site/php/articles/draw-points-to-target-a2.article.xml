	<description>This applet focuses around the method drawPointsToTarget() which draws a series of points towards a target restrained by a maximum turn angle and a steady set of distanced steps. The big acheivement for me in this version is correctly calculating which way (ClockWise or Counter-ClockWise) to turn, based on the current direction and the angle to the target. I\'m just happy it works right now.

Feel free to look over the code and spot any optimizations I can make to the logic.
