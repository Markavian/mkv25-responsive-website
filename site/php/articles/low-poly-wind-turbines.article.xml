	<description><![CDATA[These \'EUN\' Wind turbines, or windmills, were made by me as an attempt to mod Westwoods C&amp;C Generals. I gave up, too many complications.

The models are fine tho. Very low poly, they were even animated, thats right, the blades spun. The idea behind the three bases was for one to be built originally, and the other two to be added on as upgrades... increasing power output at a lower cost then building a new site.

The model was designed and built using 3D Studio Max 5, I never got round to texturing the model. Like the rest of the modding project, this was abandoned.]]></description>
