	<description>This script revolves around a particle generator core created by TomC, but a lot of the code is definitely mine, I rewrote TomC\'s functions into a rendering script that allows scaling and positioning of the image so that high res images can be produced from the rendering elements.

It still requires some work, I don\'t consider it perfect, but its a handy step forward in making apparently big things using the processing power of a PC.</description>
