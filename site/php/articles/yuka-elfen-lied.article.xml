	<description>The full name of this sketch is \'Yuka finds Kouta & Nyuu at Home\', if you\'ve watched Elfen Lied - you\'ll know the episode.

Embarassing. Good easy to draw view of Yuka at least. She has some great comedic expressions throughout the series; when I\'m better I\'ll have a go at drawing some of them.

This sketch was done along the same lines as Mayu, traced from an anime still for practice. Working on larger sheets of paper really helps. Maybe I should have used a bit more room for this one.

Later on the train I managed to reproduce this quite well from memory. Practice makes perfect; or at least gets you closer to perfection.</description>
