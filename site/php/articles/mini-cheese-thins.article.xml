... only kidding! Gee, reminded myself of that bit in Donnie Darko then. Anyhow, this is proof that I leave my computers connected to the internet for waay too long. I mean, imagine what the power bill was for that month!

I don\'t really use that account anymore, I\'ve most likely lost the password. Its handy to know how long computers run before they require restarting. I must note that Windows XP is by far the most stable version of windows I\'ve seen.

I hear Windows 2000 is better, but I don\'t use that so can\'t comment. Congratulations to Microsoft for making something that works, I wouldn\'t be here typing this message without them.]]></description>
