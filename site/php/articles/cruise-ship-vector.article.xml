	<description>This is a vector art drawing of the cruise ship I sailed on during my Easter vacation with a school in 2006. As part of that trip I took many photos, and recorded lots of experiences, which I then used to create an Interactive CD full of games, photos and pictures. 

This vector drawing of the ship provided a clean logo for the CD and introduced the journey that we went on across the mediterranean.

Traced in caring detail from a photo using Flash 8, the vector image is much crisper and more scalable then the original photo.</description>
