	<description>I found a new programming language/software based on Java called Processing.

My first script written using this new fangled lingo is shown above. A single black pixel in the centre checks its surroundings based on a set of rules, and expands. The expansion length is based on the width of the stage. Each new layer is temporarily coloured red to differ it from the previous layer.

In a constant loop, every pixel on the stage is checked to see if expansion is possible.

Maybe I should change the next script to have two, maybe three starting points, and keep the rest of the ruleset the same...

* Note surveys say 1/10 people don\'t have Java pre-installed.

This applet was created using the same technology behind another project / image that I named Polka Dot De Jong... follow the link below to find out more.</description>
