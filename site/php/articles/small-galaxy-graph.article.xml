	<description>This clever little script plots a set of random generated three-dimenionsal spiral points. The effect is meant to be a set of galaxies stacked one ontop of each other. To give a sense of height between the layers, they are gradient coloured.

This project was originally a test piece to see if a 3D galaxy of coordinates, could be suitably and quickly plotted, e.g. Galaxy Generation for an online game.

As that project died away in secret, this was left as a remanent art piece...

... until I rewrote it using Processing, instead of PHP. Spot the difference?
- Thats right: you can click on the Java applet to regenerate it instead of refreshing the page.

This is virtually a 1-1 port of the code, it does exactly the same numerical crunching as the original script.</description>
