	<description><![CDATA[This test piece was my first go ever at dealing with XML files. After it was complete I felt confident I understood a use for XML files.

All it does, it read a specially formatted XML file, and displays the contents in a visual manner.

Its quite good really! I grabbed some auto-parsing code, but also wrote alot of the stuff myself. I couldn\'t possibly comment on how efficient it is, but it does the job.

This project led onto several other important projects, such as my photo viewers.]]></description>
