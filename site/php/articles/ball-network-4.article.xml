	<description>See Ball Network 3 if you haven\'t already (the green one).

This orange hued \'project\' was an attempt at a bit more stability within a network, but with some flexibility for movement to make things more interesting.

A bit of brownian motion applied to neighbourless nodes brings the lost ones into the self serving network, where each node strives for a bit of personal space just far enough away from \'society\'. 

For each new member added, the network shifts slightly to accomodate.

However, as more and more nodes are added to their world, things started to get awfully crowded.</description>
