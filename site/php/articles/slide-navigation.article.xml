	<description>This was something I saw on another website, well, a friend pointed me towards it, and I thought it\'d be a nice challenge to copy it.

So I copied it. The idea/feature is the grey bar at the back which moves towards the current button.


I really don\'t like it. It makes the navigation feel unresponsive, even though it works exactly as I want it to. It doesn\'t really add much value to the navigation either, its simply a visual key that builds on flash\'s power, but with no point.

The code I created is quite dururable, you can download the source by following this link:

Note: (The font got messed up, I forgot to export the correct one with the movie)</description>
