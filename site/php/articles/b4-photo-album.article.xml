	<description>This was my second delve into the world of XML, and using Flash as my interpretter produced a website based photo album.

There might be the odd photo floating around that you can see, but the focus is on loading XML, and making menus and stuff.

This isn\'t exactly abandoned.. but its not very distributable, I wasn\'t comfortable with the page layouts in flash, a bit too restraining for the messaging I wanted to put across. HTML/CSS is much more effective and accessible in the majority of cases.</description>
