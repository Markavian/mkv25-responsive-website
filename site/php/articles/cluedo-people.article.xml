	<description>This iconic image was drawn up for some kinda presentation thing I was doing... I needed some generic people pictures, and went with Microsoft\'s gradient coloured faceless style. 

I\'ve done a slightly improved version of this with shaded hair too, gels each person together better. The shape of the hair was important to give the faces direction.</description>
