	<description>This guy is my first proper humanoid character. Its sorta got a face, its got some ears, arms, chest, legs, and for the most part is low-poly. Perfect for a kid style cartoon kind of game. 

Although I\'ve not done any texture work yet, I\'ve tried the scult the model as best I can giving it features based on the model. It looks like a mouse, or maybe a gremlin, I\'m not sure yet, it definitely ain\'t human though!</description>
