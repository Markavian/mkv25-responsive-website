	<description><![CDATA[I found a very cool 3D modelling plugin by recommendation called Cult3D. www.cult3d.com. Anyhow, I had to test it out, so I created a simple eightball model based on, made up a basic texture to wrap around it... and hey presto, exported it to cult3d designer, and exported as an interactive 3D model.

All good fun. Have a play.]]></description>
