	<description>A cartoony princess. I\'d never drawn anything particularly original before, always trying to copy something that already existed (Powerpuff Girls, Anime, etc.)...

... though, after doing some bitty sketches on a piece of paper, I came up with this character, who looks like a ragdoll princess. I made time to draw her up properly in Flash. Shes simply called princess.</description>
