	<description>This panorama program was made for a project at work... but I decided it had other uses, so I took some photos at my local resevoir, and began snapping.

The lighting changed drasticly between each photo, I had to do a lot of colour adjustment to get them to match, and its still not perfect. You get a nice view of the carpark though.

The viewer is made in flash, using actionscript to track the position of the mouse. Theres also a complicated bit of code that works out the zoom... but that isn\'t perfect either. Zooming was a big problem in creating the panorama, but it was a worthwhile addition.</description>
