	<description>Rathen then publishing each of these eight Flash movies separately on my website, I\'ve opted to show you the one folder.

Inspired by Skye, and her work with making a circle move from one point another... I took that concept and made some really crazy findings.

The first ones combine basic movements.
The later ones show me using Sine and Tangent curves to animate the motion of lots of black dots.

Watch and see, these are best viewed full screen, in order I guess.

I think its all very facinating. If you want an explanation, I\'ll write one. For now, I\'ll let your curiosity wander.</description>
