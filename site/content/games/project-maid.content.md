## Themes

Project maid is an employment simulator, where you get to hire maids to fill roles at very locations that you own.

Play as one of four starting characters, who have either retired, inherited, or earned they way into riches.

Hire cute maids based on their personality and work ethic.

Buy locations and expand your mini empire.

## Controls

Mouse, point and click.

## Project Status

Inactive development :'(

Outdated architecture. CI servers no longer running. Game design needs a rethink.
