## Controls

The game is a mouse/touched based game. Click on buttons to perform actions, you'll be prompted with options at each stage of the game.

## Background

Designed in 48 hours over the weekend of _August 22nd-25th, 2014_.

Developed progressively since Ludum Dare 30, the version on this site is far more advanced then anything I could make in 48 hours.
