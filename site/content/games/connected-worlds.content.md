Player Mode
-----------

Currently the only player mode is 2 human players with pass and play. The current plan is to support up to 6 player games, with a mix of human, AI and pass and play.

Controls
--------

The game is a mouse/touched based game. Click on buttons to perform actions, you'll be prompted with options at each stage of the game.

Background
----------

Designed in 48 hours over the weekend of *August 22nd-25th, 2014*.

Developed progressively since Ludum Dare 30, the version on this site is far more advanced then anything I could make in 48 hours.

Tools

*Competion rules* - all artwork, sound, and music were created by myself using publicly available tools.
