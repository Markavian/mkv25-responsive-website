# Open Source Projects

In recent years many of our projects have been opened up online. Some under ISC licenses, others without license, but all open and free to inspect and investigate. The primary goal is to create an open backup of the work being done here, and provide the potential for 3rd parties to continue projects that we may have abandoned. It also makes working with these projects much easier from around the world, without the fear of a specific piece of hardware or machine failing, and the ongoing costs with maintaining private source control systems.

If you have any questions about any of these projects; please get in touch via the specific project page.
